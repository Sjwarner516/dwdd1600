    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello everyone i'm so glad you're here! My name is Sydni Jo. I am married to the most supportive guy and together we have three little boys. When i'm not running kids around to various activities I love to bake and decorate desserts. I've always enjoyed baked goods and chocolate is my weakness. I've become the designated dessert bringer for all family parties and i absolutley love it! 
</p>

<h2>Q & A</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>How long have you been decorating cakes?</dt>
    <dd>I have been decorating cakes for three years.</dd>
  
    <dt>Why Skiddy Jo's?</dt>
    <dd>When I was a toddler i rode my trike off the front steps of my house and got some road rash skid marks on my nose. My late Aunt Janel always refered to me as Skiddy Jo from that day on!</dd>
  
    <dt>Why cakes?</dt>
    <dd>Since I was a kid i've always said my dream job was cake decorating. As I got older I didn't think it would be possible since there isn't an artistic bone in my body! With the help of some local decorating classes and a few online videos I was able to make my dream a reality!</dd>
